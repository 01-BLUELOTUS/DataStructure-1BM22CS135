<h1>LABORATORY PROGRAM-1</h1>
<h3>Write a program to simulate the working of stack using an array with the following :
a) Push
b) Pop
c) Display
The program should print appropriate messages for stack overflow, stack underflow</h3>
<h1>LABORATORY PROGRAM-2</h1>
<h3>WAP to convert a given valid parenthesized infix arithmetic expression to postfix expression. The expression consists of single character operands and the binary operators + (plus), - (minus), * (multiply) and / (divide)</h3>
<h1>LABORATORY PROGRAM-3(A)</h1>
<h3>WAP to simulate the working of a queue of integers using an array. Provide the following operations: Insert, Delete, Display
The program should print appropriate messages for queue empty and queue overflow conditions</h3>
<h1>LABORATORY PROGRAM-3(B)</h1>
<h3>WAP to simulate the working of a circular queue of integers using an array. Provide the following operations: Insert, Delete & Display
The program should print appropriate messages for queue empty and queue overflow conditions</h3>
<h1>LABORATORY PROGRAM-4(A)</h1>
<h3>WAP to Implement Singly Linked List with following operations
a) Create a linked list.
b) Insertion of a node at first position, and at end of list.
c) Delete a node at front and at the end of the list.
d) Display the contents of the linked list.</h3>
<h1>LABORATORY PROGRAM-4(B)</h1>
<h3>5. WAP to Implement Singly Linked List with following operations

a) Create a doubly linked list.
b) Insert a new node to the left of the node.
c) Delete the node based on a specific value
d) Display the contents of the list</h3>
<h1>LABORATORY PROGRAM-8</h1>
<h3>8. Write a program
a) To construct a binary Search tree.
b) To traverse the tree using all the methods i.e., in-order, preorder and post order
c) To display the elements in the tree.
d) Also perform finding the immediate predecessor and immediate successor in inorder traversal using BST.</h3>
